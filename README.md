# HTTP Workshop
This is the repository for the HTTP workshop for DevOpsDays Amsterdam 2023 ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wV--MRFlcziZMjW3yyPaBOvaYahBdBrDE4pmPkDu2tc/edit?usp=sharing)).

The `levels` directory contains a series of exercises. Each subdirectory contains a python file `server.py` which should be modified where `TODO:` comments are to complete the exercises, there is also a `README.md` with relevant documentation and things to try.
