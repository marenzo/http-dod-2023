# Level 4: Caching
For proper caching, the server needs to tell the client (or proxies along the way) if and how to cache the payload. This means we need to send the proper caching headers:
- `Cache-Control` - various directives controling cache behavior. See the docs for more info
- `ETag` - a hash of the content
- `Expires` - the date/time after which the response is considered stale
- `Last-Modified` - the time when the body (content) was generated
- `Vary` - Controls the cache subkey to allow caching of multiple variant of the same page (e.g. languages, user-agent)

## Conditional requests and browsers
Browsers have two behaviors when loading a page: _loading_ a page and _reloading_ a page. _Loading_ a page is the mode used when you type an address into the address bar, _reloading_ is used when you click on the "reload" button. _Reload_ will cause the browser to issue a conditional `GET` request, which the server is expected to answer with a `304 NOT MODIFIED` respose if the page hasn't changed or `200 OK` with the new page if it has.

So, to check your work use the _loading_ method by typing the address into the address bar (or just hit Enter if it's already typed).

## Exercises
- Implement support for conditional GET response and `304 NOT MODIFIED` response
- What is the difference between `no-store` and `no-cache` directives of the `Cache-Control` header?
- How do you tell proxies _not_ to cache a response?
